\newglossaryentry{aggregation} {name={aggregation},description={A ``has a'' or ``whole/part'' relationship between classes wherein an instance of the class representing the ``whole'' encapsulates (has) one or more instances of the class representing the part(s).

\newglossaryentry{composition} {name={composition},description={A special case of aggregation wherein the lifetimes (from construction to destruction) of the whole and part coincide}}
\newglossaryentry{inheritance}{name={inheritance},description={An special case of composition which a child class supports procedure invocations as its parent class either by delegating calls to the parent's implementations of those procedures or by overriding the parents' procedures.  Inheritance often referred to as an ``is a'' relationship or as subclassing.  OOP languages support inheritance by automating the insertion of the parent into the child and by automating the procedural delegations.  Fortran supports inheritance via type extension}}
\newglossaryentry{polymorphism}{name={polymorphism},description={The ability for one named type or one named procedure to reference many different types or procedures, respectively, and to resolve any ambiguities in referencing either at compile-time (in the case of \gls{staticpolymorphism}) or at runtime (in the case of \gls{dynamicpolymorphism})}}
\newglossaryentry{staticpolymorphism}{name={static polymorphism},description={A compile-time technology in which the compiler resolves the invocation of a generic procedure name into one of many actual procedure names based on the type, kind, and rank of the procedure's arguments at the point of invocation}}
\newglossaryentry{dynamicpolymorphism}{name={dynamic polymorphism},description={A run-time technology in which the compiler resolves the invocation of a type-bound procedure name into one of many actual procedure names based on the dynamic type of the object on which the procedure is invoked.  The dynamic type may be either the type named in the declaration of the object or any type that extends the named type}}
\newglossaryentry{typeextension}{name={type extension},description={A mechanism for designating that one derived type extends another and thereby inherits the components and type-bound procedures of the latter type}}
\newglossaryentry{instantiate}{name={instantiate},description={To construct an object as an instance of a class.  This typically involves allocating any resources the object requires (e.g., memory) and initializing the object's data.  A mechanism for designating that one derived type extends another and thereby inherits the components and type-bound procedures of the latter type}}
